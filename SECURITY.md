Please report security vulnerabilities on GitHub and draft a new
[security advisory][security advisories url]

Vulnerability reports remain private until published. When published, you will
be credited as a contributor, and your contribution will reflect the MITRE
Credit System.

Please do not disclore, or publish, security related issues publicly. This
allows time to properly fix, and report the issue to the community as a whole to
ensure everyone using the application can upgrade before being affected
by public knowledge.
