# Contributing to Valkyrja

Anybody who uses Valkyrja can be a contributing member of the community that
develops and releases it; the task of releasing Valkyrja, documentation and 
associated websites is a never-ending one. With every release or release 
candidate comes a wave of work, which takes a lot of organization and
co-ordination.

You don't need any special access to download, build, debug and begin submitting
PHP code, tests or documentation.

Thank you for your interest in helping us develop, maintain, and release the 
Valkyrja framework!
